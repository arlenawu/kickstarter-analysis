Analyzing Kickstarter campaign trends for playwright Louise

## Overview of Project
This project examines the outcomes of kickstarter campaigns for plays by analyzing the campaigns' successes or failures based on the time of year they were launched, and how high their fundraising goals were.

### Purpose
This purpose of this project is to see whether the launch date or the fundraising goals for plays on Kickstarter has any relation to whether or not a campaign is successful.

## Analysis and Challenges


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered


## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
It appears that most of the successful kickstarter campaigns for plays occurrs in May through July. Although there is a greater total number of kickstarters run during this time, a greater percentage of them were still successful compared to most other times of year. The least successful period for kickstarter campaigns is December, which is most likely due to the holiday season.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
A majority of campaigns with goals that were less than $5000 USD were successful in raising funds, but for campaigns with goals of $5000 USD or more, chances of success drop significantly. Any campaigns with goals at $45,000 USD or above are highly likely to fail to raise enough funds.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
This data set doesn't take into account other factors that could influence the outcomes of the kickstarter campaigns, such as advertisement strategies, genre of the plays, duration of the campaign, or whether or not the a campaign was chosen as a staff pick.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
It would be quite interesting to see if there are any correlations between campaign outcomes, their fundraising goals, and the duration for how long the campaigns lasted. It may also be useful to know how many backers each campaign had, and how much each campaign raised, to see on average approximately how much each backer would pledge -- this information would be useful to to gather an idea of how many people would need to be attracted in advertising campaigns.
